POETRY FORMATTING


June:
        <p>as spring flutters on into summer</p>
        <p>the scent of the wind offers passage</p>
        <p>to summers past</p>
        <br>
        <p>some moments,</p>
        <p>the sweetness of the air is laying down in the grass</p>
        <p>as the warm dusk falls around me</p>
        <p>eyes searching the skies for stars</p>
        <br>
        <p>other times,</p>
        <p>it’s the drenched maple leaves</p>
        <p>in our old backyard still dark on the heels</p>
        <p>of a storm on my 7th birthday</p>
        <br>
        <p>fragrances so poignant</p>
        <p>I half expect to blink and be thrust backward</p>
        <br>
        <p>cheeks flushed with gratitude</p>
        <p>for the wisps of beautiful memory</p>
        <p>heart leaping as the breeze shifts</p>
        <p>and the magic fades</p>

I see  your face
        <p>When I dream of where I’d rather be,</p>
        <p>A happy place where I am free,</p>
        <p>I see no land of trees or sea</p>
        <p>I close my eyes, and see your face</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I think of true beauty, but can’t find the phrase When I</p>
        <p>wish life were a movie filled with wonders every day When</p>
        <p>the skies go gray and I’ve lost my way</p>
        <p>I close my eyes, and see your face</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I pine for endless nights of fun</p>
        <p>To drink and laugh and dance a ton</p>
        <p>I tell myself the night’s still young</p>
        <p>Then close my eyes, and see your face…</p>
        <br>
        <p>But,</p>
        <p>When I sit in silence, I see your face.</p>
        <p>And when I brush my teeth, I see your face.</p>
        <p>And when I cross the street, I see your face.</p>
        <p>And when I feel the breeze, I see your face… </p>
        <br>
        <p>And when I wash my face.</p>
        <p>And when I kiss my girlfriend.</p>
        <p>And when I toss and turn and cannot sleep—</p>
        <p>When my head aches and hands shake-I see your face</p>
        <p>I flee with haste in dire need of peace and space But</p>
        <p>there’s no place I can escape— </p>
        <p>I close my eyes and want to cry— </p>
        <p>I close my eyes and wish I died, </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I close my eyes…</p>

    Mama's Mantra
        <p>Who cyaah hear, must feel.</p>
        <p>Two ears. One mouth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you must confess make it worth the voices who’s wisdoms were set to rest.</p>
        <p>Despite the heirlooms handed down from grandma, and grandma’s mother’s mom.</p>
        <p>Restrained smiles never got to flash in rebellion to those who muzzled their cheeks.</p>
        <p>Now you flash your grandfather's great-grandfathers smile.</p>
        <p>Just to appease those who pick at your teeth, salivating at the sight of blood.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Who cyaah hear, must feel.</i></p>
        <p>Take a breath. Return to center.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Listen for the message from misleading admires.</p>
        <p>How can their ears be quicker than your lips are?</p>
        <p>Like anticipating adultery in a virgin.</p>
        <p>Don’t let what you hear deceive you.</p>
        <p>Only you and I can speak mother’s tongue.</p>
        <p>Martyr or monster?</p>
        <p>Appreciate or Appropriate?</p>
        <p>The wolf doesn’t seek comfort in the sheep,</p>
        <p>Until the sheep is forced to rest.</p>
        <p>Now the wolf has food to eat.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Who cyaah hear, must feel.</i></p>
        <p>You’re being tested, remember.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Do not exchange heritage for kindness.</p>
        <p>Speech crafted from years of opposition.</p>
        <p>Attempting to make a puzzle with most pieces missing.</p>
        <p>Being sold back what was stolen in exchange for we’ve been left with.</p>
        <p>They made the bed pretty, perfect pose in the casket.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>Who cyan hear, must feel.</i></p>
        <p>The music that rolls off our tongues is jazz, with a Scratch Lee sound.</p>
        <p>Each word is a signature of vibrations that travel through our family.</p>
        <p>Something that cannot be bought and sold.</p>
        <p>The manifestations of ancestral resilience,</p>
        <br>
        <p>so say it until it feels real</p>
        <p>Who cyaah hear, must feel.</p>
