      <h4><b>Catherine</b></h4> 
      <p>Faculty Lead</p>
      <p>Catherine Black is Associate Professor and Chair of the Creative Writing BFA program at OCAD University. Catherine’s first collection of prose poetry Lessons of Chaos and Disaster was the second book in Guernica Edition’s “First Poets Series,” and her lyric nonfiction novella A Hard Gold Thread (Guernica, 2011) was nominated for the ReLit award. Her third book,  Bewilderness, was nominated for the Pat Lowther Memorial Award.  Broadly speaking, Catherine’s areas of interest and expertise in creative writing include experimentations in prose poetry and other hybrid forms such as the lyric essay and longer experimental fiction. Thematically, her work interrogates the reliability of memory, the intersections of imagination and reality, as well as issues of motherhood, ‘madness,’ and the dissociative aspects of grief and trauma.</p>

He is possessed by a deamon that feeds on misinformation; with every passing day, every growing year, his words become tainted by even more lies. There is only a matter of time until all they speak is fabrication, and all sound from his lips will become like sand. He enjoys painting minis, tabletop gaming, long walks through gardens, and pumpkin pie.</p>
